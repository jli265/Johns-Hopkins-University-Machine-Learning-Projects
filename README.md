# Johns-Hopkins-University-Machine-Learning-Projects
20+ hands-on machine learning algorithms and projects
Johns Hopkins, founded in 1876, is America's first research university and home to nine world-class academic divisions working together as one university.
Analyzing large data sets (“Big Data”), is an increasingly important skill set. One of the disciplines being relied upon for such analysis is machine learning. In this course, we will approach machine learning from a practitioner’s perspective. We will examine the issues that impact our ability to learn good models (e.g., the curse of dimensionality, the biasvariance dilemma, and no free lunch). We will then examine a variety of approaches to learning models, covering the spectrum from unsupervised to supervised learning, as well as parametric versus non-parametric methods. Students will explore and implement several learning methods, including logistic regression, Bayesian classification, decision trees, and feed-forward neural networks, and will incorporate strategies for addressing the issues impacting performance (e.g., regularization, clustering, and dimensionality reduction). In addition, students will engage in online discussions, focusing on the key questions in developing learning systems. At the end of this course, students will be able to implement and apply a variety of machine learning methods to real-world problems, as well as be able to assess the performance of these algorithms on different types of data sets.
Lecturer: Terry Leitch 
He began his career in derivatives as by building one of the first "quant" teams on Wall Street when he recruited and trained the Valuation Team at O'Connor & Associates. He moved into interest rate derivatives and designed a number of new products, such as CMS, knockout, index amortizing swaps and cross currency swaptions for bank of America in London where he led a team that priced, traded and risk-managed exotic interest rate derivatives. He was the Sr. Director of Risk Management for Boeing Capital where he designed a quantified risk pricing approach for aircraft financing. He has licensed his risk financing models to Marsh & McClennan and utilized it to advise the Export Import Bank of the US in their recent reinsurance purchase for their aircraft loan guarantee portfolio.
Terry moved back into mainstream finance when assumed the derivative executive role at Genworth Financial in 2007, just in time to experience the full force of the impending financial crisis. At Genworth, he added inflation linked assets swaps, interest rate cap/floor/collar, swaptions, and reverse repo strategies to the asset liability management toolkit. He also designed weighted hedging scheme for variable annuity products to lower hedge costs in volatile markets.
His other interests include machine learning and signal detection.
Terry has an MS in applied mathematics from Northwestern University and an MBA from the London Business School.
